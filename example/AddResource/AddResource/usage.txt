	ExePath - path of the exe
	ResFile - path of the file or directory of files to be added as a resource(s)
	ResName - (optional) name of the resource; if omitted, the application will use the filename asa the resource name
			  if ResFile denotes a directory, the ResName is ignored
	ResType - (optional) type of the resource; if omitted, the application will try to use one of the default resource types
				based on the ResFile file extension

			AddResource.exe myManagedApp.exe Help.htm help.htm 23
	
	it is equivalent to:

			AddResource.exe myManagedApp.exe Help.htm help.htm
